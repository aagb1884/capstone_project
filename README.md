# Slightly Better Reads 
## CodeClan Capstone Project

A cross-platform bookshelf app built with Java and Spring in the backend and React JS at the front.
I think there is a gap in the market for this app – targeted at parents and children’s books – and I think it will consolidate what I’ve learned on the course.

This was a solo project that I worked on for two weeks as part of my [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/) course.

## MVP

1. A working app where users can log in, search for a book, rate it out of five on a number of criteria, and add a book to the database.
2. An above average README on my Github repo so that anyone can download and run it (including clear description, screenshot, step-by-step installing instructions) - NB. This step very much a work in progress.

## What I achieved

1. A working app where users can add a book to their bookshelf, rating it out of five on one criteria.
2. This README.

I am pleased with the results. My initial ideas were – I thought – quite scaled down in terms of what I wanted to achieve (there are a lot of possible extensions on the project′s Trello board), but still turned out to be overambitious. I am sanguine about this. This was a solo project that I worked on during office hours, with limited time spent on it during evenings and weekends as I have a young family. The intention was always to provide a starting point that could be expanded in terms of functionality, and I have definitely achieved that. 

## What do I need to run it?

Here′s what you need to run it.

* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-with/react)



## BUT ANDREW, HOW DOES IT WORK?

I get that you′re excited but please stop shouting.
