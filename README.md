A cross-platform bookshelf app built with Java and Spring in the back endand React at the front.
I think there is a gap in the market for this app – targetted at parents and children’s books – and I think it will consolidate what I’ve learned on the course.

1. A working app where users can log in, search for a book, rate it out of five on a number of criteria, and add a book to the database.
2. An above average README on my Github repo so that anyone can download and run it (including clear description, screenshot, step-by-step installing instructions) - NB. This step very much a work in progress.
