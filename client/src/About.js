            <h2>About <i>Slightly</i> Better Reads</h2>
            <p>This is Andrew Blair's solo Capstone project from the 16-week intensive software development course at <a href="https://codeclan.com/">CodeClan</a></p>
            <p><i>Slightly</i> Better Reads is an app aimed at parents and carers to log their child's reading and list books they have and have not got.</p>
            <p>This is currently a basic, expandable version of the app made in two weeks. The aim is to expand the functionality of the app to provide users with an experience similar to GoodReads but tailored to the specific needs of parents and carers.</p>
            <p>The hope is to work with other CodeClan graduates to produce a full, responsive and working version of the app as a learning experience and - potentially - viable product.</p>
